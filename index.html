                <P>BAYC is a collection of 10,000 Bored Ape NFTs—unique digital collectibles living on the Ethereum blockchain. Your Bored Ape doubles as your Yacht Club membership card, and grants access to members-only benefits, the first of which is access to THE BATHROOM, a collaborative graffiti board. Future areas and perks can be unlocked by the community through roadmap activation.</P>

            <p>
                Each Bored Ape is unique and programmatically generated from over 170 possible traits, including expression, headwear, clothing, and more. All apes are dope, but some are rarer than others.
            </p>
            <p>
                The apes are stored as ERC-721 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain and hosted on IPFS.
                <a href=""> (See Record and Proof.)</a>
                Purchasing an ape costs 0.08 ETH.

            The BAYC Bathroom will become operational once the presale period is over. It contains a canvas accessible only to wallets containing at least one ape. Like any good dive bar bathroom, this is the place to draw, scrawl, or write expletives.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each ape-holder will be able to paint a pixel on the bathroom wall every fifteen minutes. Think of it as a collaborative art experiment for the cryptosphere. A members-only canvas for the discerning minds of crypto twitter.
        </p>
        <p>
            We're pretty sure it's going to be full of dicks.
